# matrix-multiplication-c

## NAIVE SOLUTION
We use the simple naive algortihm of running three nested loops.

Time Complexit - O(n^3)

## STRASSEN'S ALGORITHM
It is an optimised algorithm for multiplying two matrices using certain operations on matrices.

Time Complexity - O(n^2.807)


## Run the Code
The code will run using any C compiler.
